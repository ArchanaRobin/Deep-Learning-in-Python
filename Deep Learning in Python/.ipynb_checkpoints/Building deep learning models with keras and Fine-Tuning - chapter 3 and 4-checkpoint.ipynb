    "### 1. Creating a keras model\n",
    "Congrats. You've learned the theory of back-propagation, which is core to understanding deep learning. Now you'll learn how to create and optimize these networks using the Keras interface to the TensorFlow deep learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model building steps\n",
    "The Keras workflow has 4 steps. First, you specify the architecture, which is things like: how many layers do you want? how many nodes in each layer? What activation function do you want to use in each layer? Next, you compile the model. This specifies the loss function, and some details about how optimization works. Then you fit the model. Which is that cycle of back-propagation and optimization of model weights with your data. And finally you will want to use your model to make predictions. We'll go through these steps sequentially. The first step is creating or specifying your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model specification\n",
    "Here is the code to do that. This code has three blocks. First we import what we will need. Numpy is here only for reading some data. The other two imports are used for building our model. The second block of two lines reads the data. We read the data here so we can find the number of nodes in the input layer. That is stored as the variable n_cols. We always need to specify how many columns are in the input when building a Keras model, because that is the number of nodes in the input layer. We then start building the model. The first line of model specification is model equals Sequential. There are two ways to build up a model, and we will focus on sequential, which is the easier way to build a model. Sequential models require that each layer has weights or connections only to the one layer coming directly after it in the network diagram. There are more exotic models out there with complex patterns of connections, but Sequential will do the trick for everything we need here. We start adding layers using the add method of the model. he type of layer you have seen, that standard layer type, is called a Dense layer. It is called Dense because all of the nodes in the previous layer connect to all of the nodes in the current layer. As you advance in deep learning, you may start using layers that aren't Dense. In each layer, we specify the number of nodes as the first positional argument, and the activation function we want to use in that layer using the keyword argument activation. Keras supports every activation function you will want in practice. In the first layer, we need to specify input shapes as shown here. That says the input will have n_cols columns, and there is nothing after the comma, meaning it can have any number of rows, that is, any number of data points. You'll notice the last layer has 1 node. That is the output layer, and it matches those diagrams where we ended with only a single node as the output or prediction of the model. This model has 2 hidden layers, and an output layer. You may be struck that each hidden layers has 100 nodes. Keras and TensorFlow do the math for us, so don't feel afraid to use much bigger networks than we've seen before. It's quite common to use 100 or 1000s nodes in a layer. You'll learn more about choosing an appropriate number of nodes later.\n",

    "In practice, optimization is a hard problem. The optimal value for any one weight depends on the values of the other weights, and we are optimizing many weights at once. Even if the slope tells us which weights to increase, and which to decrease, our updates may not improve our model meaningfully. A small learning rate might cause us to make such small updates to the model's weights that our model doesn't improve materially. A very large learning rate might take us too far in the direction that seemed good. A smart optimizer like Adam helps, but optimization problems can still occur. The easiest way to see the effect of different learning rates is to use the simplest optimizer,\n",

    " \n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent, sometimes abbreviated to SGD. This optimizer uses a fixed learning rate. Learning rates around point-01 are common. But you can specify the learning rate you need with lr argument as shown here. We have a function that creates a new model here. We create models in a for loop, and each time around we compile the model using SGD with a different learning rate. We pass in the optimizer with the same argument where we previously passed the string for \"Adam\". In an exercise, you will compare the results of training models trained with low, medium and high learning rates. Even if your learning rate is well tuned, you can run into the so-called\n",

    "\n",
    " -  The dying neuron problem\n",
    " \n",
    "\"dying-neuron\" problem. This problem occurs when a neuron takes a value less than 0 for all rows of your data. Recall that, with the ReLU activation function, any node with a negative input value produces an output of 0, and it also has a slope of 0 as you see in this graph. Because the slope is 0, the slope of any weights flowing into that node are also 0. So those weights don't get updated. In other words, once the node starts always getting negative inputs, it may continue only getting negative inputs. It's contributing nothing to the model at this point, and hence the claim that the node or neuron is \"dead.\"At first, this might suggest using an activation function whose slope is never exactly zero. However, those types of functions were used for many years."

    "#### Adding layers to a network\n",
    "You've seen how to experiment with wider networks. In this exercise, you'll try a deeper network (more hidden layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, you have a baseline model called `model_1` as a starting point. It has 1 hidden layer, with 50 units. You can see a summary of that model's structure printed out. You will create a similar network with 3 hidden layers (still keeping 50 units in each layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will again take a moment to fit both models, so you'll need to wait a few seconds to see the results after you run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Specify a model called `model_2 `that is like `model_1`, but which has 3 hidden layers of 50 units instead of only 1 hidden layer.\n",
    " - Use input_shape to specify the input shape in the first hidden layer.\n",
    " - Use `'relu'` activation for the 3 hidden layers and `'softmax'` for the output layer, which should have 2 units.\n",
    " - Compile `model_2` as you have done with previous models: Using `'adam'` as the `optimizer`, `'categorical_crossentropy'` for the loss, and `metrics=['accuracy']`.\n",
    " - Hit `'Submit Answer'` to fit both the models and visualize which one gives better results! For both models, you should look for the best `val_loss` and `val_acc`, which won't be the last epoch for that model."

    "We've already done the basic manipulation of the MNIST dataset shown in the video, so you have X and y loaded and ready to model with. Sequential and Dense from Keras are also pre-imported.\n",

    "To add an extra challenge, we've loaded only 2500 images, rather than 60000 which you will see in some published results. Deep learning models perform better with more data, however, they also take longer to train, especially when they start becoming more complex.\n",

    "If you have a computer with a CUDA compatible GPU, you can take advantage of it to improve computation time. If you don't have a GPU, no problem! You can set up a deep learning environment in the cloud that can run your models on a GPU. Here is a blog post by Dan that explains how to do this - check it out after completing this exercise! It is a great next step as you continue your deep learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to take your deep learning to the next level? Check out `Advanced Deep Learning with Keras` to see how the Keras functional API lets you build domain knowledge to solve new types of problems. Once you know how to use the functional API, take a look at `Image Processing with Keras in Python` to learn image-specific applications of Keras.\n",

    " - reate a Sequential object to start your model. Call this `model`.\n",
    " - Add the first Dense hidden layer of `50 units` to your model with `'relu' activation`. For this data, the` input_shape` is `(784,)`.\n",
    " - Add a second Dense hidden layer with `50 units` and a `'relu' activation` function.\n",
    " - Add the `output layer`. Your activation function should be `'softmax'`, and the number of nodes in this layer should be the same as the number of possible outputs in this `case: 10`.\n",
    " - Compile model as you have done with previous models: Using `'adam'` as the `optimizer`, `'categorical_crossentropy' `for the `loss`, and `metrics=['accuracy']`.\n",
